Reward related functions are always more potent and more motivating than aversion, therefore drug abuse behavior is stronger in addicts. The reward machine connects sure systems in such a way that they generate the feeling of pleasure for sure behaviors or stimulus given to the frame. In every day life, it's far activated with the aid of wholesome, existence-sustaining activities like eating and socializing. But 'Drug Abuse' is every other behavior that generates euphoria, that's loved via the mind. And human nature is to repeat the ones moves that deliver us some specific delight.
